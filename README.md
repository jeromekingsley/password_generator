How It Works
User Input:

Enter the desired password length (between 6 and 20).
Optionally, select the checkbox to include special characters in the password.
Password Generation:

Once the form is submitted, the PHP script processes the inputs and generates a random password using a mix of:
Lowercase letters
Uppercase letters
Numbers
Special characters (if selected)
Result Display:

The generated password is displayed in a styled box beneath the form.
Usage
Password Length: The minimum password length is 6 characters, and the maximum length is 20 characters. Adjust the value within the allowed range.
Include Special Characters: You can choose to include special characters like !@#$%^&*() to make your password more secure.
Example Workflow
Set the password length to 12 characters.
Check the box for special characters.
Click Generate Password.
The tool displays a random password like: g3#Fg9zM!k0W.
Styling & Features
Dynamic Gradient Background: The page has a colorful animated background that smoothly transitions between colors, making it visually appealing.
Hover Effects: Buttons and input fields have hover effects that change colors and slightly scale up for better interactivity.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on mobile devices.
Customization
You can customize the tool in the following ways:

Password Rules: Modify the generatePassword function to include additional rules, such as ensuring at least one uppercase letter or one special character.
Design: Adjust the CSS styles, including the background colors, fonts, and button styles.
Character Sets: Add or remove characters from the lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and specialChars variables in the PHP script to adjust the set of characters used for password generation.
